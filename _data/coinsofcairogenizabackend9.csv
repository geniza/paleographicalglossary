ccg0004,ashrafi_file.jpg,ashrafī ,أشرفي אשרפי,,image/jpeg,"Gold coin minted by the Mamluk Sultanate between 1425CE-1517CE, first under Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay, that was intended to counter the dominance of Venetian ducat in Egypt (Pamuk, 60, 65). At the time of the ashrafi's initial production the Mamluks outlawed the Venetian ducat in their domain and set the standards/exchange rates of this coinage in a strategic manner that would constrain the buying power of Venetian coinage. Along these lines, Bacharach explains ""the weight of the ashrafi was given as equal to the ducat. [However], the weight of the ashrafi, calculated from numismatic evidence, was about 3.41 grams and almost of pure gold. Therefore in a completely free market, the ashrafi should have been worth 97 per cent of the ducat's (3.51 grams) value.... In simpler terms, Basbary's edict made the ashrafi, rather than the ducat, the overvalued coin "" (Bacharach, 88). Although the exact standards of the Mamluk coin ceased to exist with the Ottoman conquest, the Mamluk ashrafi influenced the initial development of the Ottoman-era ""sherifi/şerifi,"" which remained a locally minted Egyptian gold coin until the late 17th century when variety of new gold competitors with the Venetian ducat emerged. As Pamuk notes, ""a number of new gold coins called tugrali, cedid Istanbul, zincirli, findik and zer-i mahbub were initiated between 1697 and 1728. All but the last of these started close to the standards of the ducat.

The word can be traced back to Hindi bihār 'sack', the standard vessel in which spices were imported, hence the goods came to be referred to metaphorically in terms of the container in which they arrived.""

ccg0010,dinar_file.jpg,dīnār ,دينار דינאר,mithqāl,image/jpeg,"Gold coin minted under various state entities in Egypt that requires an especially detailed description and array of citations. The Fatimid Caliphate ""continued the Roman-Byzantine monetary system both in its name, which goes back to Latin denarius, and in its weight. Its standard weight was 4.233 grams, and.... in general, dinars struck in different cities under the various Fatimid caliphs did not differ in weight or alloy."" In addition to this general overview, Goitein also noted in the that ""several direct and indirect testimonies of the Geniza prove that 2 dinars were regarded as a monthly income sufficient for a lower middle class family. For the sake of illustration, it seems therefore permissible to equate the economic value of a dinar with that of approximately a hundred [c.1960-1970] U.S.A. dollars."" (Goitein, MS I, 359) This estimate of the medieval gold dinar's buying power still holds in 21st-century scholarship. (Goldberg, xix). During the Fatimid era other versions of the dinar, especially the Almoravid, became mainstays of the international economy (for an in-text example, see: DK 322r l. 16). Oberbauer notes that ""there was a high demand for murābiṭī dinars in Egypt ca. 1100 due to the fact that this coin... was quickly becoming the international medium of payment, for which reason traders from the Maghreb demanded to be paid in it."" (Oberauer, 440). 

The Crusader States minted imitations of the Fatimid dinar that were intended to exist at parity with one another. Malloy et. al. note that, ""after marching down the coast of Syria, the Crusaders conquered Jerusalem in June, 1099, they assumed the problems of maintaining control of their conquest. Surrounded by Islamic states, most formidable of which was the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, Latin Jerusalem, in order to survive, had to deprive the neighboring Saracen states of theis Syrian ports and gain control of their profitable conquest. Part of this process was the counterfeiting, as it may be called, of Fatimid gold money. After seizing some of the Egyptians' ports in Syria, which happened to have functioning or recently functioning gold mints - Acre, for example, in 1104, and Tyre in 1124 - the Crusaders continued issuing gold dinars in order to increase the revenues of the state and to facilitate trade.... no gold mints existed in Byzantine-influenced northern Syria, though Constantinopolitan gold circulated there. Chroniclers tells us that the gold coins of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII (1071-78) were especially favored and still current in northern Syria. Egyptian influenced southern Syria and Palestine, on the other hand, had had several Fatimid mints producing gold dinars. Since silver coins had virtually ceased to be minted and copper fals were rare in the Fatimid Caliphate, the gold denomination was the principal coin used in the south. It has also been suggested that the Crusaders, because they knew that the Arabic gold was more stable and of higher intrinsic value on the international market that the contemporary Byzantine gold hyperpyron, chose the Arabic coin. Opportunity and necessity, therefore provided Latin Christians in Jerusalem, who had known no gold currency in the Frankish West, with an Islamic-type gold coinage.... The Crusaders also minted Ayyubid types during the thirteenth century, one specimin in imitation of the Ayyubid prince Saladin (1169-93)"" (Malloy et. al., 27; see also, Ehrenkreutz, 167-180). 

The Ayyubid sultans continued Fatimid-era standards but the dinar was produced in Egyptian mints rather than Syrian ones. As Bresc notes: ""the fracture between the two [regional] spheres consists in the primary metal employed for the striking: gold or silver. Gold coinage of the Ayyubid period is mostly Egyptian. Struck with great care, dinars were issued in Cairo and Alexandria. The weights of the dinars varied as gold became scarcer in Ayyubid Egypt.... However, the dinar's alloy remained almost unchanged in the time and contains a percentage of fine gold of about 96-97%, which is slightly lower than under the Fatimids.... So while gold and billon were coined essentially in Egypt, silver and copper coins were the regular currencies of Syria."" (Bresc, 409-410.) 

The Mamluk sultans continued minting the dinar and there are a number of regnal variants that aid in dating Geniza documents. Bacharach notes ""during the first period of Mamluk rule, the Bahri (648-784/1250-1382), there were only minor changes initiated in monetary policy.... The Bahri dinars were of a high degree of fineness, but the weight of individual pieces varied from 5 to over 15 grams.... The usual official exchange rate of 1 dinar to 20 dirhams referred not to a real dinar but a theoretical gold coin of 4.25 grams. This weight was known as the mithqal."" (Bacharach, 80). Across the Burji Mamluk period a variety of dinar variants also existed such as the harja (rarely minted after 1407CE), the Sālimī (minted beginning in 1401CE), and the Naṣirī– which also emerged in the early 1400s to replace the Sālimī (Ibid, 85-86, 91). These latter variants emerged yet became defunct in quick succession as a result of repeated Mamluk efforts to curtail the Venetian ducat's circulation and buying power in 14th-15th-century Egypt. The most succesful attempt to counter the circulation of Venetian currency came with the development of the ashrafi dinar, first under Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay in 1425-1428CE (Pamuk, 60, 65). 

The term ""dinar"" is also occasionally used in documents from the Ottoman period en lieu of ""sultani"" (Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire, 183; Hanna, 191).

Goitein observes that ""the other fractions of a dinar, continuously mentioned in letters and accounts, such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/6, 1/8, as a rule, were not coins, but mostly represented money of account. The dinar was divided into 24 carats [qīrāṭ].... the qīrāṭ too was money of account... [and] was subdivided into three ḥabbas, or grains, and six dānaqs. In different areas and periods these subdivisions had varying values; those indicated here are the ones found in Geniza documents. The 1/24, 1/72, and 1/144 dinars mentioned in this book refer to qīrāṭ, ḥabbas, and dānaqs, respectively."" (Goitein, MS I, 359) 
The popularity of the Fatimid quarter dīnār led to a wide variety of imitations (known as ""tarì"") from the eleventh century onwards yet it is crucial to note that the latter term was also used to designate Fatimid money before Norman imitations first appeared. Day notes accordingly, ""by the middle of the tenth century, payments not only in Salerno but also in Amalfi and Naples were rendered almost exclusively in tari. Before the last quarter of the century, stipulations for payment to be rendered in tari referred to the Arab quarter-dīnār, and thereafter such stipulations referred also to their southern Italian imitations. What this reflects is the definitive abandonment of the silver denarius in southern Italy, or at any rate Campania, and the first genuine 'return to gold' in Western Christendom."" (Day, 43-44).

ccg0013,dirham_file.jpg,dirham,درهم דרהם,,image/jpeg,"Silver coin minted under the Fatimid caliphate that Goitein observes had two major variants: firstly, ""nuqra"" which was pure silver and exhanged on average at 40:1 with the gold dinar. There also existed low value dirhams whose exchange rates were more variable (Goitein, MS I, 390) that were referred to as ""dirham waraq"" or ""dirham aswad"" (Balog, 123; Diem and Radenberg,  66). Goitein notes that these lower-value dirhams become more common in Geniza documents after the Fatimid period (Goitein, MS I, 388).

After the Fatimid period, the ""nuqra"" dirham and lower value ""waraq"" or ""aswad"" variant continued to exist, yet a wide array of other coin types emerged under the Ayyubids such as the Nāṣiri and Kāmilī (Balog, ""History of the Dirhem in Egypt,"" 126-130). Bresc notes, however, that ""during the thirteenth century, the majority of the bulk of silver produced in Egypt consisted of these dirham aswad whose coinage ended under the rule of the Sultan al-Kamil."" Bresc, ""Quseir al-Qadim: a Hoard of Islamic Coins from the Ayyubid period,"" 410). By the early 1200s once the buying power of Ayyubid dirham coins had become clear, the Crusader States began to mint imitation dirhams. Malloy et. al. explain that ""during the Ayyubid period the Moslem Syrian mints of Aleppo and Damascus issued high quality silver coins, while Egypt's silver supply was so limited that the Egyptian silver coins became quite inferior....The [Ayyubid] Syrian dirhams were nominally worth three times the Egyptian waraq dirhams and approximately 1/13.5 the dinar. As far as we know, beginning in the first quarter of the thirteenth century, the Crusaders also began to issue silver coins in direct imitation of the Ayyubid Syrian dirham. The Crusaders, therefore, did not begin their issue of imitative dirhams until the relative strength of the Syrian dirhams was well apparent.... The Cusader imitations again are of similar weight and alloy to their prototypes, averaing 2.78 grams. The Crusader issues with Christian dates, religious creeds, and non-sectarian religious inscriptions"" (Malloy et. al., 28)

Under the Mamluk Sultanate a variety of new dirham types were issued, such as the Zāheri, Maḥmūdi, and Muayyadi (which can each assist with dating given that they are regnal variants). In the fifteenth century, the Mamluk dirham lost much of its value with reference to the dinar and exchanged at ratios as low as 320:1 and even 460:1 (Balog, 134-135). Despite the significant drop in buying power in the fifteenth century, the Mamluk ""muayyadi"" dirham variant retained widespread significance as a label for half-dirhams in Ottoman Egypt (although the weight/purity standards had shifted).",coin; Medieval; Fatimid; Ayyubid; Mamluk; Ottoman,,"ENA 4011.62 line 7, ENA NS 18.26 line 4",Jewish Theological Seminary Library,Images provided by courtesy of the Jewish Theological Seminary Library (JTSL),https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,"Balog, Paul.

As Pamuk notes, ""In the place of the sultani, a number of new gold coins called tugrali, cedid Istanbul, zincirli, findik and zer-i mahbub were initiated between 1697 and 1728. All but the last of these started close to the standards of the ducat. Following the practice dating back to the fifteenth century, the government did not attach a fixed face-value to these gold coins. Their exchange rates were determined by the markets. In payments to the state, gold coins were accepted at the official rates of exchange.""

Kāmilī dirhams had a relatively low silver content (roughly 33%) and were minted in order to replace black dirhams, whose production ceased in 1225 CE as part of al-Kāmil's currency reforms (Schultz, 232-233). Ehrenkreutz notes, the end of production did not prevent these prior coinage types from circulating after 1225 CE and that ""exchange rate of the new [Kāmilī] dirhams was fixed by the authorities at 37 : 1, and later at 35 : 1 [dīnār].""

Ehrenkreutz, explains, ""considering that the 100 per cent silver nuqra dirhams stood at 13 1/3 to 1 [dīnār], and the 30 percent silver waraq dirhams stood at 40 to 1, it is reasonable to assume that the exchange value of the Naṣirī dirhams was 26 2/3 to 1"" (Ehrenkreutz, 503-504). Al-Nāṣir Ṣalāh al-Dīn established the Nāṣirī dirham variant in an unsuccesful effort to abolish production/circulation of black dirhams given the inconsistencies in their fineness and the resulting ""inconvenience in weighing them.""

ccg0020,wariqdirham_file.jpg,wariq dirham ,من الورق מן אלורק,,image/jpeg,"A variant of the medieval dirham that was of lower silver content and is sometimes referred to interchangeably as ""dirham aswad"" in Judeo-Arabic and ""kesafīm sheḥorīm"" in Hebrew. This form of coinage took its name from the discoloration of silver that had been alloyed with copper, tin, and other metals to produce what is known today in English as ""billon"" alloy. The silver content of wariq dirhams was commonly 33% or less. Bresc also notes, that ""during the thirteenth century, the majority of the bulk of silver produced in Egypt consisted of these dirham aswad whose coinage ended under the rule of the Sultan al-Kamil [in 1225 CE]"" (Bresc, 410-411; Ehrenkreutz, 504). There is not a consensus in the secondary literature as to whether ""wariq/waraq"" was always an interchangeable term with ""dirham aswad."" While Bresc interprets them as one and the same, Goitein estimates that black dirhams could have an exchange value as low as 100 to 1 dīnār, whereas wariq/waraq dirhams had a higher value of 50 to 1 (Goitein, MS I, 388). Assuming that these coinage types were the same, the variation Goitein uncovered might be explained by the fact that the fineness of low-quality dirhams was often inconsisent and led to multiple attempts by Ayyubid sultans at abolishing their production/circulation.
