ccg0001,akçe_file.jpg,akçe,"Silver coin minted in the Ottoman empire as early as the fourteenth century that ceased to appear in circulation by the mid-seventeenth century yet remained in some contexts as a unit of account (Ibid, 147; Ben Naeh, Jews in the Realm of Sultans, 29) In Hebrew-language documents ""levanīm"" or ""white ones"" was used because the term ""akçe"" referenced the Turkish root word ""ak"" meaning ""white"" (Pamuk 34).",1326-1687 CE
ccg0002,ardab_file.jpg,ardab ,"Unit of volume in the medieval period that Goitein notes proportionally ""the wayba comprised about 15 liters (approximately 4 gallons) and the irdabb consisted of 6 waybas. [1 irdabb = ~90 liters]"" (Goitein, Mediterranean Society I, 361) Given the nominal similarity of Goitein's reference to irdab and the Ottoman-era ardab, it is crucial to note the continuity of this unit's value across the centuries. Accordingly, White observes that in the Ottoman empire an ardab by the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was ""equal to about 70 kilograms or 90 liters."" (White, Climate of Rebellion, xv)",
ccg0003,aspros_file.jpg,aspros,"Alternative term in western European languages for the Ottoman akçe (Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire, 34) which was a silver coin minted in the Ottoman empire as early as the fourteenth century that ceased to appear in circulation by the mid-seventeenth century yet remained in some contexts as a unit of account (Ibid, 147; Ben Naeh, Jews in the Realm of Sultans, 29) In Hebrew-language documents ""levanīm"" or ""white ones"" was used because the term ""akçe"" referenced the Turkish root word ""ak"" meaning ""white"" (Pamuk, 34).",1326-1687 CE
ccg0004,ashrafī (late mamluk dinar)_file.jpg,ashrafī (late Mamluk dīnār),"Gold coin minted by the Mamluk sultanate between 1425CE-1516CE, first under Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay, that was intended to counter the dominance of Venetian ducat in Egypt (Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire, 60, 65). At the time of the ashrafi's initial production the Mamluks outlawed the Venetian ducat in their domain and set the standards/exchange rates of this coinage in a strategic manner that would constrain the buying power of Venetian coinage. Along these lines, Bacharach explains ""the weight of the ashrafi was given as equal to the ducat. [However], the weight of the ashrafi, calculated from numismatic evidence, was about 3.41 grams and almost of pure gold. Therefore in a completely free market, the ashrafi should have been worth 97 per cent of the ducat's (3.51 grams) value.... In simpler terms, Basbary's edict made the ashrafi, rather than the ducat, the overvalued coin "" (Bacharach, ""The Dinar versus the Ducat,"" 88). Although the exact standards of the Mamluk coin ceased to exist with the Ottoman conquest, the Mamluk ashrafi influenced the initial development of the Ottoman-era ""sherifi/şerifi,"" which remained a locally minted Egyptian gold coin until the late 17th century when variety of new gold competitors with the Venetian ducat emerged. As Pamuk notes, ""a number of new gold coins called tugrali, cedid Istanbul, zincirli, findik and zer-i mahbub were initiated between 1697 and 1728. All but the last of these started close to the standards of the ducat. (Ibid,167)",1425CE-1516 CE
ccg0005,ashrafi alzahiri_file.jpg,ashrafī al-ẓāhirī,A variant of the gold ashrafī minted during the rule of one of the Mamluk sultans who took the regnal name al-Ẓāhir after 1425 CE (the year the coin was first produced). ,1425CE-1516 CE
ccg0006,bahar_file.jpg,bahar ,"Unit of weight that Goitein uncovered in his research on the medieval India traders of the Cairo Geniza, mentioning that: ""the Bahār, a weight of 300 pounds and its twentieth or 1/24 part, the Farāsila, certainly are not Arabic."" (Goitein, India Book Notes, 4C.2.7 page 6) Goitein's suspicion on linguistic etymology has since been confirmed by the linguist Janet Watson's observations on aspects of Yemeni Arabic: ""an example of the metaphorical extension of a term is Ṣanʿānī bahārāt 'spices', which is also found in Standard Arabic and other dialects of Arabic today. The word can be traced back to Hindi bihār 'sack', the standard vessel in which spices were imported, hence the goods came to be referred to metaphorically in terms of the container in which they arrived."" (Watson, ""On the linguistic archaeology of Ṣanʿānī Arabic,"" 407) Goitein later noted that this unit's value could vary widely, see for example page 344 in the India Book. The unit's value eventually shifted to 11.8 kilograms or 22 lbs 6 oz in nineteenth-century Egypt (Marsot, Egypt in the Reign of Muhammad Ali, X).",

ccg0008,bunduqi_file.jpg,būndūqī,"Alternative term in the Ottoman empire for gold ducats minted by Venetian Republic, other equivalent labels include ""efrenciye"" and ""flori"" (Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire 65, 99). In Geniza sources and other documents from the pre-modern eastern Mediterranean great care must be taken not to misidentify the Venetian gold ducat as a Florentine gold florin. While the latter circulated at comparatively lower rates of distribution in the eastern Mediterranean and can be ruled out after 1533CE in dating documents (its final year of production), the Venetian gold ducat can appear ambiguously in Hebrew as ""פרחים/flowers"" or as a direct loanword in other languages with ""flori"" which again translates to ""flowers"" in regional variants of Italian. (Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire, 99)",1284-1799 CE
ccg0009,corona_file.jpg,corona,"Gold coin minted within the Spanish empire that can appear in Judeo-Arabic with the alternate spelling ""קורונה"" (T-S Misc. 28.168r l.17) or as ""dablūn"" which is an escudo gold coin (AIU VII.F.39r line 28). As Tortella and García Ruiz note, ""the monetary system – the set of monetary units – which Spain used through the early modern period well into the nineteenth century was created by Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic Monarchs, at the close of the Middle Ages.... The Catholic Monarchs found a chaotic monetary situation upon their joint assumption of the crown.... Their monetary reform of 1497 established a trimetallic system whose main units were the excelente, a gold coin (also called ducat, escudo, or doblón); the real de plata, a silver coin (later known as real de a ocho, peso duro, thaler, or dollar) and the blanca, a vellón coin.... Vellón is... an alloy of copper and silver."" (Tortella and García Ruiz, Spanish Money and Banking, 6-7). The escudo is also referred to as a ""corona"" in Geniza documents, an alternative label confirmed by the secondary literature (Royo Martínez, ""Antecedentes de la reforma monetaria de Felipe II,"" 87) and it should be noted that the standards of the coin shifted significantly in 1535CE to the extent that official references distinguished ""escudos"" as distinct from ""ducados"" minted according to the standards of 1497CE. (Ruiz Trapero, ""El Real de a Ocho,"" 359).",post-1497 CE
ccg0010,dinar_file.jpg,dīnār ,"Gold coin minted under various state entities in Egypt that requires an especially detailed description and array of citations. The Fatimid caliphate ""continued the Roman-Byzantine monetary system both in its name, which goes back to Latin denarius, and in its weight. Its standard weight was 4.233 grams, and.... in general, dinars struck in different cities under the various Fatimid caliphs did not differ in weight or alloy."" In addition to this general overview, Goitein also noted in the that ""several direct and indirect testimonies of the Geniza prove that 2 dinars were regarded as a monthly income sufficient for a lower middle class family. For the sake of illustration, it seems therefore permissible to equate the economic value of a dinar with that of approximately a hundred [c.1960-1970] U.S.A. dollars."" (Goitein, A Mediterranean Society I, 359) This estimate of the medieval gold dinar's buying power still holds in 21st-century scholarship. (Goldberg, Trade and Institutions in the Medieval Mediterranean, xix). During the Fatimid era other versions of the dinar, especially the Almoravid, became mainstays of the international economy (DK 322r l. 16). Oberbauer notes that ""there was a high demand for murābiṭī dinars in Egypt ca. 1100 due to the fact that this coin... was quickly becoming the international medium of payment, for which reason traders from the Maghreb demanded to be paid in it."" (Oberauer, ""Money in Classical Islam,"" 440). The Crusader States minted imitations of the Fatimid dinar that were intended to exist at parity with one another. Malloy et. al. note that, ""after marching down the coast of Syria, the Crusaders conquered Jerusalem in June, 1099, they assumed the problems of maintaining control of their conquest. Surrounded by Islamic states, most formidable of which was the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt, Latin Jerusalem, in order to survive, had to deprive the neighboring Saracen states of theis Syrian ports and gain control of their profitable conquest. Part of this process was the counterfeiting, as it may be called, of Fatimid gold money. After seizing some of the Egyptians' ports in Syria, which happened to have functioning or recently functioning gold mints - Acre, for example, in 1104, and Tyre in 1124 - the Crusaders continued issuing gold dinars in order to increase the revenues of the state and to facilitate trade.... no gold mints existed in Byzantine-influenced northern Syria, though Constantinopolitan gold circulated there. Chroniclers tells us that the gold coins of the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII (1071-78) were especially favored and still current in northern Syria. Egyptian influenced southern Syria and Palestine, on the other hand, had had several Fatimid mints producing gold dinars. Since silver coins had virtually ceased to be minted and copper fals were rare in the Fatimid Caliphate, the gold denomination was the principal coin used in the south. It has also been suggested that the Crusaders, because they knew that the Arabic gold was more stable and of higher intrinsic value on the international market that the contemporary Byzantine gold hyperpyron, chose the Arabic coin. Opportunity and necessity, therefore provided Latin Christians in Jerusalem, who had known no gold currency in the Frankish West, with an Islamic-type gold coinage.... The Crusaders also minted Ayyubid types during the thirteenth century, one specimin in imitation of the Ayyubid prince Saladin (1169-93)"" (Malloy et. al., Coins of the Crusader States, 27) See also, Ehrenkreutz, ""Arabic Dinars Struck By the Crusaders,"" 167-180. The Ayyubid sultans continued Fatimid-era standards but the dinar was produced in Egyptian mints rather than Syrian ones. As Bresc notes: ""the fracture between the two [regional] spheres consists in the primary metal employed for the striking: gold or silver. Gold coinage of the Ayyubid period is mostly Egyptian. Struck with great care, dinars were issued in Cairo and Alexandria. The weights of the dinars varied as gold became scarcer in Ayyubid Egypt.... However, the dinar's alloy remained almost unchanged in the time and contains a percentage of fine gold of about 96-97%, which is slightly lower than under the Fatimids.... So while gold and billon were coined essentially in Egypt, silver and copper coins were the regular currencies of Syria."" (Bresc, ""Quseir al-Qadim: a Hoard of Islamic Coins from the Ayyubid period,"" 409-410.) The Mamluk sultans continued minting the dinar and there are a number of regnal variants that aid in dating Geniza documents. Bacharach notes ""during the first period of Mamluk rule, the Bahri (648-784/1250-1382), there were only minor changes initiated in monetary policy.... The Bahri dinars were of a high degree of fineness, but the weight of individual pieces varied from 5 to over 15 grams.... The usual official exchange rate of 1 dinar to 20 dirhams referred not to a real dinar but a theoretical gold coin of 4.25 grams. This weight was known as the mithqal."" (Bacharach, ""The Dinar Versus the Ducat,"" 80). Across the Burji Mamluk period a variety of dinar variants also existed such as the harja (rarely minted after 1407CE), the Sālimī (minted beginning in 1401CE), and the Naṣirī– which also emerged in the early 1400s to replace the Sālimī (Ibid, 85-86, 91). These latter variants emerged yet became defunct in quick succession as a result of repeated Mamluk efforts to curtail the Venetian ducat's circulation and buying power in 14th-15th-century Egypt. The most succesful attempt to counter the circulation of Venetian currency came with the development of the ashrafi dinar, first under Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay in 1425-1428CE (Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire, 60, 65). The term ""dinar"" is also occasionally used in documents from the Ottoman period en lieu of ""sultani"" (Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire, 183; Hanna, Making Big Money in 1600, 191). For one such example, see: Yevr.-Arab. II 1511r line 22.",

As Pamuk notes, ""In the place of the sultani, a number of new gold coins called tugrali, cedid Istanbul, zincirli, findik and zer-i mahbub were initiated between 1697 and 1728. All but the last of these started close to the standards of the ducat. Following the practice dating back to the fifteenth century, the government did not attach a fixed face-value to these gold coins. Their exchange rates were determined by the markets. In payments to the state, gold coins were accepted at the official rates of exchange."" (Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire,167).",post-1697 CE
