## How to Use the Numismatic Timeline in Estimating a Fragment's Dating

This shelfmark demonstrates how certain numismatic references can assist us in determining a chronological "bottom line" for a fragment. Although this debt acknowledgement is brief and undated, the designation of the dirhams as Kāmilīyye **(כאמליה)** in line four makes it possible to estimate the year of recording as no earlier than 1225 CE (622 AH). Sultan al-Kāmil Nāṣr ad-Dīn Muḥammad (r. 1218-1238 CE) issued this form of dirham in an effort to end the circulation of lower-quality silver currency in the Ayyubid realm. Accordingly, the Coins of the Cairo Geniza Paleographical Glossary designates this coinage type as a "regnal variant."
