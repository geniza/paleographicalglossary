## How to Use the Numismatic Timeline in Estimating a Fragment's Dating

The shelfmark below demonstrates how certain numismatic references can assist us in tracing a chronological "bottom line" for a given fragment. Although this debt acknowledgement ENA NS 19.17 is brief and undated, the designation of the dirhams as *Kāmilīyye* (כאמליה) in line four makes it possible to estimate the year of recording as **no earlier than 1225 CE (622 AH)**. At this point in time, Sultan al-Kāmil Nāṣr ad-Dīn Muḥammad (r. 1218-1238 CE) implemented new mintage standards for dirhams in an effort to curtail the circulation of lower-quality silver currency in the Ayyubid realm. Accordingly, the Paleographical Glossary designates this coinage type with the tag [regnal variant](https://geniza.github.io/paleographicalglossary/browse.html#regnal%20variant). There are two other methods in which numismatic references can help us determine the earliest year in which a fragment could have been recorded. The first method revolves around the instances in which state entities founded brand new coinage types: a phenomenon that became more common with the onset of Ottoman imperial rule in Egypt. The third method is the most rare and is attested in a handful of documents that reference the standards implemented by heads of the local mint in Cairo 
(see: [mint standard](https://geniza.github.io/paleographicalglossary/browse.html#mint%20standard)). Taken together, these three chronological lines of analysis have yielded the metadata behind the CCG Numismatic Timeline.
